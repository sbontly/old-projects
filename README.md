# old-projects

These projects I created when I was learning TouchDesigner.

I am unsure of the current condition of these, however id like to share them with you.

Muriel:

  A project made for a birthday party. Basically, an automated projection sequence with a basic control panel. When in perform mode, the user can come and adjust a few compositing settings a colors to change the feel of the environment.
  
Martian Show:

  A project made for a monologue performance in Berlin, Germany. It is an A/V support for an actor as he performs. It was an impromtu performance which required the flexibility to change the timeline. I created trigger sequences that I controlled through the FOH.
  
Light Color:

  A theater group that that was an ongoing development, where we explored the concepts of light and color in respects to the Ocean. This included DMX lighting as well as projected visuals.
  
Surfer Dude:

  A basic production for a music video, all created in TD. Linked to a MIDI controller, I recorded the video and triggered effects and animations live to produce the video.

DMX lighting system:
  
  I started to creat a basic light control system using the Enttec Open DMX ethernet device. I realized later on that Data translation happens faster in CHOPs, at which point I had moved on to other projects
